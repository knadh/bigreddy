# BigReddy

BigReddy is a small utility that generates pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-poetic ramblings. When you're feeling down or you need some motivation in life, you go to BigReddy.

Under the hood, the utility uses Markov Chains to generate text.

## Install
```shell
pip install bigreddy
```

## Usage
Once installed, on your commandline, run: ```bigreddy```. Every time you run the utility, it'll generate fresh a new quote.

Example:
```shell
$ bigreddy 

Names so beautiful, so is the average man, with laser-like focus.
